# [Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE)](http://uxd-rcue.rhcloud.com) reference implementation

The Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE) project was created to promote design commonality across all of Red Hatâ€™s Enterprise product offerings.

This reference implementation of RCUE is based on [Bootstrap v3.0.0](http://getbootstrap.com/); therefore, [Bootstrap v3.0.0](http://getbootstrap.com/) is required in order for it to work properly.

## Development

Development setup requires nodejs. If you do not already have nodejs and npm installed on your system, please see https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager for how to install on your distribution.

After ensuring nodejs and npm are available, install [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally:

    npm install -g bower

Now that bower is available, we can install the required development components:

    bower install

At this point, you should now have a top level components/ folder with all dependencies listed in the bower.json file installed.
