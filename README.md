# [Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE)](http://uxd-rcue.rhcloud.com) reference implementation

The Red Hat Common User Experience (RCUE) project was created to promote design commonality across all of Red Hatâ€™s Enterprise product offerings.

This reference implementation of RCUE is based on [Bootstrap v3.0.0](http://getbootstrap.com/3.0.0/); therefore, [Bootstrap v3.0.0](http://getbootstrap.com/3.0.0/) is required in order for it to work properly.
